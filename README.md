# PokeRogueOffline

A fully offline wrapper for PokéRogue, available on iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux. Play fully offline with local saves, or import your save from [pokerogue.net](https://pokerogue.net).

## Features

- Fully offline — no internet required after install
  - Exception: Starting a daily run will *attempt* to connect to this repo, but is not required.
- Local saves that persist between sessions
- Import saves from your online account
- Based on the latest `main` branch of [pagefaultgames / pokerogue](https://github.com/pagefaultgames/pokerogue/)

## What's New

### New Features
- Added a **Clear All Data** option in Settings → Offline — this deletes all current data. **USE WITH CAUTION**.
- This is the **only** offline client that loads the actual server daily seed. Useful when there are special event daily runs.
- Includes the build number in the banner for support reasons.

### Changes to How the App is Built
The app pulls directly from the official PokéRogue source and applies a small set of targeted fixes on top of it. This means the app will always be up to date with whatever the official game ships, with no manual syncing required.

# iOS

## Getting the IPA

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/PokeRogue-Offline/pokerogue-offline/releases) and download `PokeRogueOffline.ipa` from the latest release.

## Installing the IPA

### Option 1: LiveContainer + SideStore (Recommended — unlimited apps)

LiveContainer lets you run IPAs inside a container without using up your sideloading slots.

**First-time setup:**
1. Install **iLoader** on your PC/Mac from [GitHub](https://github.com/nab138/iloader)
2. Connect your iPhone via USB and open iLoader
3. Sign in with your Apple ID
4. Select **LiveContainer + SideStore** and install it
5. Open LiveContainer on your device and complete the setup (import certificate from SideStore)

**Installing PokeRogueOffline:**
1. Download `PokeRogueOffline.ipa` to your iPhone (via Safari or Files)
2. Open LiveContainer and tap the **+** button in the top right
3. Select the IPA file
4. Tap the app to launch it

> **Note:** LiveContainer signs the app with your SideStore certificate automatically — no manual signing needed.

---

### Option 2: SideStore (without LiveContainer)

SideStore lets you sideload up to 3 apps and refresh them wirelessly without a PC after setup.

1. Install SideStore using iLoader or AltServer
2. Open SideStore and tap **+** in My Apps
3. Select `PokeRogueOffline.ipa`
4. Apps must be refreshed every 7 days (can be automated with a Shortcuts automation)

---

### Option 3: Feather / Sideloadly

If you already use Feather or Sideloadly, just sign and install the IPA as you normally would.

---

# Android

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/PokeRogue-Offline/pokerogue-offline/releases) and download `PokeRogueOffline.apk` from the latest release.

- Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Settings
- Download and install the APK
- Note: APK is debug-signed, you may need to allow installation

---

# Windows

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/PokeRogue-Offline/pokerogue-offline/releases) and download `PokeRogueOffline.exe` from the latest release.

- Run the EXE directly — no installation required
- **Requires WebView2**, which ships with Windows 11 and is installed automatically on Windows 10 via Windows Update. If you get an error on launch, download it from [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)

---

# Linux

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/PokeRogue-Offline/pokerogue-offline/releases) and download `PokeRogueOffline.AppImage` from the latest release.

- Run it: `./PokeRogueOffline.AppImage`
- **Requires WebKitGTK**. Most desktop Linux distributions (Ubuntu 24.04+, Fedora 40+, etc.) include this by default. If the app fails to launch, install it with:
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install webkitgtk6.0`
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S webkit2gtk-4.1`
